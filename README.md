## **General Flow** (Updated: 25/5/2021)
Click [here](https://github.com/CodenCommunity/JobBuddy/blob/main/assets/images/flowchart) to see the flowchart of the bot

|Order|Task|
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1. | Channel 1 for the bot to send a message and others cant send any messages. |
| 2. | Employers/HR react to that message with the emoji that has already popped up |
| 3. | The bot sends a private message to the Employer/HR inbox and ask for specific information such as company name, job requirements, salary range, location, benefits, contacts and more (**TBC**)
| 4. | After all requirements are answered, the bot will compile and send the job posting to Channel 2. The emoji reacted in Channel 1 will be toggled off after job is posted. 
| 5. | Interested members can react to the job posting by the bot in channel 2 with a specific emoji (no one can send message here)
| 6. | Bot will private message member for information like experience, GitHub/LinkedIn handle, and more (**TBC**)
| 7. | Bot will compile all info and send to Employer/HR private message.
| 8. | The employer/HR can then filter all interested candidates and reach out through the information provided.
